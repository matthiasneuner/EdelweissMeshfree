Welcome to EdelweissMeshfree
============================

EdelweissMeshfree is a light-weight, platform-independent, parallel meshfree framework for the simulation of coupled problems in solid mechanics.
It is based on `EdelweissFE <https://github.com/EdelweissNumerics/EdelweissFE/>`_, which is a hard dependency.
Furthermore, by default, it makes use of the `Marmot <https://github.com/MAteRialMOdelingToolbox/Marmot/>`_ library for cell, material point, particle, and material formulations.

EdelweissMeshfree aims to be...

 - ... a development and learning environment for constitutive models and meshfree methods such as the **Material Point Method (MPM)** and **Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM)**,
 - ... an easy to use tool for coupled problems,
 - ... a very flexible tool for implementing and employing special techniques (e.g., the indirect displacement control technique),
   which are often more difficult and time consuming to implement in mature, MPI-parallelized codes,
 - ... an efficient tool for nonlinear simulations up to medium sized problems (~ :math:`10^5` degrees of freedom).

Execute a simulation
********************

Unline EdelweissFE, EdelweissMeshfree does not make use of input files.
All simulations are directly executed via Python scripts.

Run a simulation simply by calling

.. code-block:: console

    python your_simulation.py
