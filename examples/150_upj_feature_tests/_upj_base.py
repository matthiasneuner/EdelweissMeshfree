"""Shared tiny u-p-J plane-strain compression problem for the per-feature
verification tests in this directory.

Each ``upj_<feature>_test.py`` calls :func:`run` with ONE feature toggled and
asserts a sane result. Target runtime: < 3 s per test (typically ~0.2-0.5 s).

Rationale: the large Cook's-membrane and plane-strain-compression shear-band
scripts were numerical STUDIES -- they exercised every feature at once, took many
seconds, and have been moved OUT of the repo. These files are the opposite: one
tiny, fast, isolated check per feature, so a regression in any single feature is
caught immediately and adding a test for a NEW feature is a copy-paste of one short
file.

They use the self-contained model-builder ``run_sim`` in ``_upj_compression.py``
(extracted from the former example 146) at a 4x8, nearly-elastic, 2-increment
scale. The exact solution of this homogeneous compression is a near-uniform
(negative) pressure field, so a finite field with a negative mean is the basic
sanity signal.
