"""Plane-strain compression shear band with the mixed u-p-J
(DisplacementPressureJacobi) particle and LOCAL finite-strain J2 plasticity
(FiniteStrainJ2Plasticity, Voce softening).

Purpose: compare the two VMS pressure stabilization modes of the particle on a
problem with strongly nonlinear, isochoric (plastically incompressible)
material response and localized deformation. Both modes share the
orthogonal-subscale (OSS) fluctuation penalty on grad(p) at the smoothing-domain
face centers with tau = alpha h^2/(2 G_elastic) -- it kills pressure
checkerboarding without diffusing the resolved (physical) pressure field:

    vmsMode = 0 : fluctuation penalty only (pressure-only stabilization)
    vmsMode = 1 : additionally weights the RESOLVED-scale strong-form momentum
                  residual grad(p) + div(S_dev) - rho0*a (full VMS). CAUTION:
                  the div(S_dev) tangent is only approximate in the plastic
                  regime (second-order material derivatives unavailable), so
                  Newton robustness degrades for large alpha.

Domain      : 60 mm x 120 mm, nX x nY quad particles (default 15 x 30)
BCs         : mortar weak Dirichlet (smooth multiplier field -> no forced
              boundary pressure checkerboard, cf. example 134):
              - bottom edge : roller (uy = 0)
              - top edge    : prescribed compression uy = totalCompression
              - bottom-left : ux = 0 pin (Lagrange, single particle)
Material    : FiniteStrainJ2Plasticity [K, G, fy, fyInf, eta, H, impl, density]
              E = 11920, nu = 0.49 (K/G ~ 50, near-incompressible elasticity;
              the plastic flow is exactly isochoric). Voce softening
              beta(alpha) = fyInf + (fy - fyInf) exp(-eta alpha) + H alpha with
              fy = 100, fyInf = 80, eta = 20, H = 0 (a 20 % drop at a MODERATE rate:
              localizes a clear diagonal band AND produces a genuine post-peak load
              drop that plain displacement control traces for every vmsAlpha in
              mode 0; fyInf/eta are CLI-swept). Two failure modes bracket this
              choice: eta = 15 is too GENTLE -- the load merely plateaus (no real
              drop) and the near-zero tangent plus plastic switch cycling stalls
              Newton right at the peak (this was the old default and the reported
              "fails before the band forms"); eta = 30 is too STEEP -- the peak
              becomes a near-singular snap-back that plain displacement control
              cannot trace at all (needs arc length / control='indirect').
              fyInf = 90 is too mild and forms no band.
              NOTE: the softening is LOCAL, so the band width is set by the
              particle spacing (no regularization) -- fine for the purpose of
              comparing pressure stabilizations, NOT mesh-objective.
Imperfection: 5 % yield-stress reduction in a 2x2-particle block at the
              bottom-left corner to seed the band (as in examples 144/145).
Particle    : DisplacementPressureJacobiSQCNIxNSNI/PlaneStrain/Quad
Solver      : NonlinearQuasistaticSolver (implicit), adaptive time stepper

Loading     : displacement control to totalCompression = -1.9 mm (default).

Peak-crossing: at the load peak (u_y ~ -0.9 mm) the diagonal shear band forms as
a near-bifurcation (nearly singular tangent) and the plastic loading/unloading
state cycles between iterations. Two ingredients make plain displacement control
traverse it robustly for EVERY vmsAlpha in mode 0:
  1. MODERATE softening (eta = 20, see Material) -- a genuine post-peak drop, not
     the flat plateau of the too-gentle eta = 15 that stalled Newton at the peak.
  2. A line search with SMALL trial step lengths ({0.15,0.4,0.7,1.0}, enabled from
     the 2nd iteration). The default alphas {0.8,1.0,1.2} are all too large to
     damp the strong-stabilization limit cycle: there the trial residual is
     monotone increasing in the step, the quadratic fit runs off to the alpha=1.5
     clamp, and the cycle never breaks (this was the vmsAlpha=0.5 stall).
Mode 1 (full VMS) still degrades for large alpha because its div(S_dev) tangent
is only approximate in the plastic regime: it crosses for alpha <~ 0.1 but stalls
at the peak for alpha = 0.5 even with the tuned line search -- use mode 0 there,
or control='indirect' (arc length). The known run-to-run non-determinism of the
Marmot plastic path (open issue, cf. example 144; -ftrivial-auto-var-init=zero
does NOT fix it) only jitters the post-peak branch by a few percent now; it no
longer decides whether the peak is crossed.

WARNING (2026-07-15, measured -- see handoff_vms.md part 5): the crossing
statements above hold for the TOTAL-field OSS stabilization (particles receiving
assignTotalNodalSolution). With the INCREMENT-form stabilization (total-nodal-
solution interface removed) the same configurations STALL at the peak (10x20,
alpha=0.02, inc 0.01: stalls at u=0.90mm; alpha=0 crosses, so it is the
alpha-scaled increment-form penalty that blocks the band's pressure
reorganization). Workarounds in increment form: alpha=0, or incSize <= 0.002
(15x30 crosses with 0.002). The peak itself is a LOCAL-softening bifurcation:
band width is always ~2 particle spacings (12mm at 10x20 -> 8mm at 15x30, mesh-
dependent) and the stall point moves earlier under refinement (u=0.90/0.88/0.82mm
at nX=10/15/20) -- only a regularized material makes this mesh-objective.
control='indirect' (band-slip arc length) does NOT cross the bifurcation even
with the line search now ported to the arc-length inner Newton.

Observed (nX=10, nY=20, eta=20/fyInf=80 defaults, bottom edge fully fixed
{ux=uy=0}, displacement control, u = -5 mm):
- clean diagonal band from the bottom-left imperfection to the top-right corner
  (alphaP localization max/mean ~ 9.6, band alphaP ~ 0.22 at u = -3 mm).
- mode 0 crosses the peak (F_y ~ 6.5 kN) and traces the ~15-29 % softening drop
  for alpha in {0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0}; mode 1 for alpha in {0.1}.

    """The integration/constraint knobs are ported verbatim from example 134
    (Cook's membrane) so the same variants can be studied here on a NONLINEAR
    (finite-strain, softening J2) localizing problem. See the run_sim docstring
    of example 134 for the detailed rationale and the measured Cook's-membrane
    behaviour of each option; only the geometry-specific mapping differs:

    - the DRIVEN edge is the top (uy = totalCompression, face 3), the ROLLER is
      the bottom (uy = 0, face 1); both carry only the y component. The x
      rigid-body mode is removed by the single-particle bottom-left ux pin,
      which stays a Lagrange point constraint for every constraintType.
    - control : 'displacement' (default) prescribes the top uy directly and
      cannot cross the softening-band load peak once the pressure stabilization
      is strong (alpha >~ 0.05) -- the tangent is near-singular at the limit
      point (see the measured failures in the module docstring). 'indirect'
      switches to INDIRECT DISPLACEMENT CONTROL: the top is loaded by a UNIFORM
      reference pressure scaled by an unknown load factor lambda (no flat platen
      -- a platen + mean-uy control is algebraically identical to displacement
      control), and the arc-length controller drives a LOCAL band slip -- the
      relative uy of two particles straddling the diagonal band at the
      bottom-left imperfection -- monotonically up to abs(totalCompression). That
      slip keeps growing through the load peak while lambda (and the mean
      shortening) may snap back, so the softening branch is traceable. 'indirect'
      requires constraintType='mortar' and cwfCorrection='off' (the top has no
      displacement BC to enforce/correct); it is solved by the arc-length solver
      (no predictor -- the base updateHistory does not thread the load factor).
      The load-displacement plot x-axis is then the imposed band slip, not the
      global shortening.
    - particleType : SQCNIxNSNI (default) or SQCNIxSDI, as in 134.
    - constraintType : 'mortar' (default, smooth multiplier -> no forced
      boundary pressure checkerboard), 'lagrange' (point collocation, with
      constraintStride), or 'nitsche' (NITSCHEDIRICHLET load, beta =
      nitscheBeta * K / h). Do not combine 'nitsche' with cwfCorrection.
    - cwfCorrection : consistent-weak-form traction term on the constrained edges,
      'off' / 'top' (driven edge only) / 'bottom' (reaction roller only) /
      'both'. Both edges constrain only uy, so the mask is (0, 1). Conditionally
      stable, see 134.
    - vci / vciOrder : variationally consistent integration over all four edges.
    - completenessOrder : RKPM completeness order (must be >= vciOrder); order 2
      widens the support radius (2.2 -> 3.2 particle spacings) as in 134."""
